# NMC Drone Club supporting documents
This repository is aiming to help students participating in NMC Drone Club maintain a basic knowledge of how a fixed-wing drone would work. 
For club members struggling to build your drone, the notes folder also includes visual representation of each part of the fixed-wing drone we are making.
